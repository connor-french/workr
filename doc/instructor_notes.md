# Instructor notes

First, this idea of hosting workshops as an R package turned out to not be the best. If you feel motivated, I would recommend migrating the workshop materials to their own github repos as standalone workshops.  

The workshop materials are located in the `workr/inst/tutorials` folder. There, you can find the folders for each project, and then there is a `.Rmd` file that you can edit.  

There are pre-workshop materials in the `workr/doc` folder. There is a short `intro_to_R` tutorial for those who want to participate, but don't have much R experience. It's in multiple formats for you to share as you wish. In addition, there are preworkshop instructions. Make sure to update these annually with the appropriate version numbers!  

I would recommend brushing up with `learnr` before running these workshops and make sure everything is bug-free on different operating systems and R versions well ahead of the workshop date. Otherwise, these are straightforward to run! They would do well as synchronous/asynchronous workshops as well, since everything is writting and there are interactive tutorials. 

One last thing- the presentations are in the gc.digitalfellows gmail in the `R_RUG/workshop_materials` folder.
