## Install/Update R & RStudio

Contents borrowed and modified from [UVA's Data Science Essentials in R series](https://uvastatlab.github.io/phdplus/intror.html)

### Before the first session

To participate in the R workshop, please bring a laptop with R and RStudio installed. We recommend that you have the latest version of R (3.6.1) and of the `tidyverse` package (1.2.1). You need to have RStudio installed, but it is less crucial that you are using the most recent version (1.2.5001).

Do you already have R and RStudio installed?  

* No - follow the instructions for “I do not have R installed”  
* Yes - follow the instructions for “I have R installed”

### “I do not have R installed”

You should install R, RStudio, and `tidyverse`.

#### Installing R

##### Windows:
1. Go to https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/
2. Click the “Download R 3.6.1 for Windows” link.
3. When the file finishes downloading, double-click to install. You should be able to click “Next” to all dialogs to finish the installation.

##### Mac:
1. Go to https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/macosx/
2. Click the link “R-3.6.1.pkg”
3. When the file finishes downloading, double-click to install. You should be able to click “Next” to all dialogs to finish the installation.

##### Linux:
For any adventurous Linux users in our group follow [this guide](https://github.com/duckmayr/install-update-r-on-linux) to install/upgrade to the most recent version of R on Ubuntu (18.04) or Mint (19).

#### Installing RStudio
1. Go to [the RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).
2. Under “Installers for Supported Platforms” select the appropriate installer for your operating system
3. When the file finishes downloading, double-click to install. You should be able to click “Next” to all dialogs to finish the installation.

#### Installing `tidyverse`

1. Open RStudio
2. Go to `Tools` > `Install Packages`
3. Enter `tidyverse`
4. Select `Install`

### “I have R installed”

The workshops run more smoothly when everyone is using the same version of R and `tidyverse`. Please update R and `tidyverse`, if necessary (and less crucially, RStudio).

#### Verify R version

Open RStudio. At the top of the Console you will see session info. The first line tells you which version of R you are using. If RStudio is already open and you’re deep in a session, type `R.version.string` in the console and enter to print out the R version.

Do you have R version 3.6.1 installed?

* No - follow the instructions for “Updating R”
* Yes - Great! Do you have `tidyverse` installed?
  + No or I don’t know - See “Installing `tidyverse`”
  + Yes - Great! Go to Go to Tools > Check for Package Updates. If there’s an update available for `tidyverse`, install it.

#### Updating R/RStudio/Tidyverse

##### Windows
To update R on Windows, try using the package `installr` (only for Windows).  

1. Install and load installr:  
```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("installr")
library(installr)
```  
2. Call `updateR()` function. This will start the updating process of your R installation by: “finding the latest R version, downloading it, running the installer, deleting the installation file, copy and updating old packages to the new R installation.”  
3. From within RStudio, go to Help > Check for Updates to install newer version of RStudio (if available, optional).

##### Mac
On Mac, you can simply download and install the newest version of R. When you restart RStudio, it will use the updated version of R.  

1. Go to https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/macosx/  
2. Click the link “R-3.6.1.pkg”  
3. When the file finishes downloading, double-click to install. You should be able to click “Next” to all dialogs to finish the installation.  
4. From within RStudio, go to Help > Check for Updates to install newer version of RStudio (if available, optional).  
5. To update packages, go to Tools > Check for Package Updates. If updates are available, select All (or just `tidyverse`), and click Install Updates.

##### Linux:
Again, for any adventurous Linux users in our group follow [this guide](https://github.com/duckmayr/install-update-r-on-linux) to install/upgrade to the most recent version of R on Ubuntu (18.04) or Mint (19).
